Fixed issues in SaferWatch API Integration 

JAN 11 2017 (Time Spent 8 Hours)
--------------------------
1) It looks like the system maybe be calling the saferwatch api when clicking on the carrier menu or maybe it is showing the safer watch icon incorrectly. 
2) When adding a carrier to a load, if you click on the SaferWatch icon within the carrier drop down list it opens up the SaferWatch web in the same window.
 Instead if should open up in a new tab so the user keeps the load open on the original tab.
3)  Once a day we need to call the GetChangedCarriers api as described in the video. I am guessing we should display a message to the user as this is happening.
4) SystemConfig.SaferWatchUpdateCarrierInfo = False then do not update Carrier Name, Address, City, State, Zip, Phone and Fax numbers when doing a CarrierLookup update or GetChangedCarriers update.
